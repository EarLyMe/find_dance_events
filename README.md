# FindDanceEvents

Welcome to Find Dance Events! This gem enables the user to find interesting and upcoming dance events in a few different countries. The information for this gem is scraped from a website called DanceCal, the url for which is here: http://dancecal.com/. The program will take a user's selected country and display a list of events that take place there and can also give more information on a specific event if the user so chooses.
